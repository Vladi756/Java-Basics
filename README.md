# Learning-Java
I will be uploading every Java exercise I do in my learning journey on to this repository. Every exercise, every tutorial I do will be found here. I am starting off with the "Thinking in Java Textbook" and therefore the exercises, and their corresponding solutions can all be found here. 

You can easily navigate to the problems and their solutions by changing the branch you're on. As you can see, in the main branch all there is is this read me file which acts as a sort of guide for the rest of the repository. The actual code can be found in the other branches.
